**Project description:** 
The goal of this project is to develop a user interface on a computer for controlling an industrial robot via programmable logic controller (PLC). Instead of using teach pendant, robot control should be enabled via external interface and allows the user direct access to robotic functions. The developed interface should also allow remote control and supervision of programmable logic controller which is used for controlling the robot. The task was to create a program that allows you to assign control commands in the progremmable logic controller, which are trensferred in to the robot's teach pendant. It is necessary to link all components into a unique system using appropriate communication protocols and to create control algorithms.

### About Me
I always thought my dream was to be a mechanical engineer working for a large manufacturing company, designing parts for different types of machinery and overlooking the process of producing such parts. It seemed like an appropriate dream given my studies, but after doing an internship in a cardboard manufacturing company, it kind of felt like I wanted to do something different and that it wasn't for me.

Just as I was handing in my bachelor's thesis, I got an opportunity for an abroad internship at a robotics company. During that internship, I designed parts for robot systems, but also, I was introduced to programming industrial robots by using Python and ROS framework. I realized this was the thing I was missing and I got hooked on programming. Programming calls to all my passions which include solving challenges and applying creativity while I'm allowed to test, break and improve the code.

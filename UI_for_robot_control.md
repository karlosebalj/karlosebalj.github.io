**Project description:** 
The task of this project is to develop the control of a mobile robot through the application of Robot Operating System (ROS). Robot Operating System enables robot control and provides the appropriate environment for development of modular management program support, communication infrastructure which connects program components as well as the open source library of implemented algorithms. In order to complete this assignment, it is necessary to review all components of a mobile robot system, test their accuracy and replace them with suitable new components. Furthermore, it is required to connect new components with the old components in order to make a unique system and to create program support using ROS for its control. Complex control, which should be developed using simple control of a mobile robot, enables two types of control, manual and autonomous.
